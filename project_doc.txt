limitations:

1. parsing of devanagri script
solution: wx notation for input and output

2. obtaining weather data
    a. api
        - does not provide all required fields
        - cannot be requested by date/not date stamps either (all relative)
        - requires coordiated WOEID
        - cannot search by place name
        - no history/forecast
        - not available for indian data
        - service shut down
    b. website
        - lack of standard formatting
        - no historical data
        - not all fields for forecast
        - services not provided for india
        - tool for webscraping not working correctly
        - sometimes slow response
solution: use imd site, but only the table for daily info - weekly forecast not preserved on scraping using bs4
          for weekly data use dummy values, just to demonstate procedure/working

hence, domain restricted to queries of frour types regarding the current day and general query for rest of the week


day_data = []
# max_t, dep_max, min_t, dep_min, rain, hum_morn, hum_even, avg_t, avg_h
week_data = [] # index 0 for current day, indices 1-6 for following week, index 7 for weekly averages
# [ max_t, min_t, avg_t, avg_h ] is each element

note:
- only capital cities
- city names accepted in english
- old and new names both accepted
